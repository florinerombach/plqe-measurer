# plqe-measurer

# Currently, the program will save your data in the same directory that it is placed in (I should probably change this in the future). Please also save the calibration folder in the same directory that you run the program from, otherwise the analysis will not run!

# This program measures the PLQE of your samples with a common background/empty measurement, and automatically applies nonlinearity corrections to your measurements.
# Some (equilibriation) waiting times in the program may need to be adjusted for your samples - let me know if your measurements don't look how they normally look!
